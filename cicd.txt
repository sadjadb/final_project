CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment.
It’s a set of practices and tools that automate how software is built, tested, and released,
so teams can ship changes faster and more reliably.

Continuous Integration (CI)

Goal: Frequently merge code changes into a shared repository and automatically test them.

How it works:

1. Developers push code to a shared repo (e.g., Git).

2. An automated pipeline builds the app.

3. Automated tests run (unit, integration, etc.).

4. The system reports success or failure immediately.

Why it matters:

- Catches bugs early

- Prevents “it works on my machine” issues

- Keeps the main branch always usable

Common CI tools:

- Jenkins

- GitHub Actions

- GitLab

- CircleCI

Continuous Delivery (CD)

Goal: Automatically prepare code for release to production.

After CI passes:

The system deploys the app to staging/test environments.

Final release to production is a manual decision (one click).

Benefit: You can release anytime with confidence.

Continuous Deployment (also CD)

Goal: Automatically release every change to production without human intervention.

If all tests pass:
Code goes live immediately.

Benefit: Fastest delivery cycle
Risk: Requires very strong automated testing and monitoring

CI/CD Pipeline (Simplified Flow):
Code → Build → Test → Deploy → Monitor

Why companies use CI/CD

- Faster releases

- Higher software quality

- Less manual work

- Lower risk of big failures

- Quick feedback for developers
